This is my first attempt at making a git FUSE filesystem.

It creates a filesystem that lets you "cd" into any tag or branch and see
your data in there as if you had just checked out a fresh copy of that branch. 
Forward slashes are turned into backslashes

The directory entries have correct file size but bogus date and owner.

In theory it could be made to support individual commits. It could also be
made writeable somehow, perhaps using rename of the parent dir to signal a
commit?

This is currently a filthy hack that I whipped up in a couple of hours. It needs
to be cleaned up (and perhaps even rewritten it in C).


Dependencies
============

rugged gem - for accessing git
RubyFuse gem - for Fuse. 

nb. It took me a while to these compiled on Ruby 1.9, so Ruby 1.8 is probably the
best bet for now.



Example Usage:
=============


mkdir myrepo
usermount -u myrepo  # ensure it is unmounted from previous sessions
ruby gitrepofs.rb /path/to/git/repo/ myrepo

ls -la myrepo 

dr-xr-xr-x 1 user user 4096 Apr 29 13:41 .
drwxrwxr-x 3 user user   61 Apr 29 13:41 ..
dr-xr-xr-x 1 user user 4096 Apr 29 13:41 heads
dr-xr-xr-x 1 user user 4096 Apr 29 13:41 tags
