GitRepoFS
=========

This is my attempt at making a git repository FUSE-based filesystem.

Unlike the other similar ones out there, it lets you "cd" into any tag or
branch and see your data in there as if you had just checked out a fresh
copy of that branch.

(In theory it could be made to support individual commits. It could also be
made writeable somehow, perhaps using rename of the parent dir to signal a
commit?)


Limitations
===========

Slashes in tag/branch names are turned into backslashes in the filesystem.

The directory entries have correct file size but bogus date and owner.

This is currently a filthy hack, that I whipped up in a couple of hours
using much cutting and pasting.  It needs to be cleaned up (and perhaps even
rewritten it in C).



Dependencies
============

rugged gem - for accessing git
RubyFuse gem - for Fuse. 

nb. It took me a while to get these compiled on Ruby 1.9, so Ruby 1.8 is
probably the best bet for now.



Example Usage:
=============


mkdir myrepo
usermount -u myrepo  # ensure it is unmounted from previous sessions
ruby gitrepofs.rb /path/to/git/repo/ myrepo

ls -la myrepo 

dr-xr-xr-x 1 user user 4096 Apr 29 13:41 .
drwxrwxr-x 3 user user   61 Apr 29 13:41 ..
dr-xr-xr-x 1 user user 4096 Apr 29 13:41 heads
dr-xr-xr-x 1 user user 4096 Apr 29 13:41 tags
